#Chapter 5: Probability

A basic understanding of probability and statisitics is vital to becoming a
data scientist. Afterall, that is what makes you different from a software
engineer. Please complete this chapter before moving on to ```Chapter_6_statistics```.

If you feel like you need a review, there are very abridged lecture notes in
the ```readings``` folder that will catch you up to speed. They are in PDF, so
you need to download the repo to view them. If you feel the
lecture notes are insufficient, please reach out to one of our instructors.

```
Here is a recommended order to read the lecture notes in

 - combinatorics_lecture
 - conditional_probability_lecture
 - random_variables_lecture
 - binomial_lecture
 - poisson_lecture
 - normal_exponential_lecture
 ```
In addition to the PDF's provided, Khan Academy offers a very nice probability course online for free:  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability

There are 10 questions in ```probability_assignment.md``` covering various
aspects of basic probability theory. They represent the baseline understanding
you need to have about probability to understand the course material
we are going to cover in the future weeks.

Each question in ```probability_assignment.md``` is worth **10 points**.

**7 points** go to showing the steps to arrive at the answer.

**3 points** goes to getting the correct answer.

Please fill in your solution in the ```probability_assignment.md```. Do that
by downloading the repo (which you should already have done). Then
open ```probability_assignment.md``` in a text editor.

_**Fill in your solution to
each question right below the question before the next question starts.**_
